Securify Website - Smart Traffic Management and Security System
Welcome to the Securify repository! This project aims to enhance the current traffic management systems by incorporating advanced modules for improved efficiency and security. The Securify website, along with several innovative modules, ensures a smarter and safer traffic management system, protecting against threats and security breaches.

Project Overview
Securify Website
The Securify website is the central hub for managing and monitoring the traffic system. It provides a user-friendly interface for accessing various features and functionalities, ensuring seamless operation and management.

Modules
AI-Based Phishing Attack Detection Model: This module leverages artificial intelligence to detect and prevent phishing attacks in real-time. By analyzing patterns and behaviors, the model can identify potential threats and mitigate them before they cause harm.

HWID Ban: The Hardware Identification (HWID) Ban module adds an extra layer of security by blocking devices with known malicious activity. This prevents repeat offenders from accessing the system, enhancing overall security.

Smart Traffic Management: Integrating smart algorithms, this module optimizes traffic flow, reduces congestion, and improves response times to incidents. It ensures efficient use of resources and enhances the overall traffic management system.

Conclusion
The Securify project combines cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions to create a robust and secure traffic management system. By implementing these modules, we aim to provide a safer and more efficient environment, free from security breaches and threats.

Feel free to explore the repository and contribute to the project. Together, we can build a smarter and safer traffic management system.
